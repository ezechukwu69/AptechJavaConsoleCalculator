## Getting Started

Welcome to Aptech E-project calculator console based app

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Optionally add the "-d" flag followed by a dirctory path where you want to output the file

## Running the app

To run the project navigate into the "src/" directory and run the following commands

```bash
javac com/calculator/Main.java
java com.calculator.Main
```
